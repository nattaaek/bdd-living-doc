## About the Project

This POC showcases how you can transform your BDD specifications into an interactive web application using:

- 🌌 **Astro**: For building fast and content-focused websites.
- ⚛️ **React**: For creating dynamic and interactive UI components.
- 💙 **TypeScript**: For type-safe code that scales.
- 🌐 **WebSockets**: For real-time updates to your documentation.
- 📡 **Axios**: For fetching data from our backend service.

Our goal is to create a tool that keeps your documentation in sync with your codebase, making it easier for teams to understand and collaborate on the application's behavior.

## Features

- **Dynamic Feature List**: Automatically displays all your BDD features.
- **Interactive Scenarios**: Expandable scenarios to dive into the steps.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Documentation updates live as you change your BDD specs.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with Astro, React, and TypeScript for a seamless developer experience.
- **Easy Setup**: Get up and running quickly with minimal configuration.
