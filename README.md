# 🌟 BDD Living Documentation POC

Welcome to the **BDD Living Documentation** project! 🎉

This proof-of-concept (POC) aims to bring your Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) specifications to life, turning them into interactive and dynamic documentation that's both **engaging** and **informative**. Say goodbye to stale documentation and hello to a living, breathing representation of your application's behavior! 🚀

## About the Project

This POC showcases how you can transform your BDD specifications into an interactive web application using:

- **Frontend**: Built with 🌌 **Astro**, ⚛️ **React**, and 💙 **TypeScript** for a seamless developer experience.
- **Backend**: Powered by ⚙️ **Rust** for blazing-fast performance and reliability.

Our goal is to create a tool that keeps your documentation in sync with your codebase, making it easier for teams to understand and collaborate on the application's behavior.

---

## Features

- **Dynamic Feature List**: Automatically displays all your BDD features.
- **Interactive Scenarios**: Expandable scenarios to dive into the steps.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Documentation updates live as you change your BDD specs.
- **Modern Stack**: Built with cutting-edge technologies on both frontend and backend.
- **Easy Setup**: Get up and running quickly with minimal configuration.

## Getting Started

Ready to bring your BDD documentation to life? Let's get started! 🎈

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **pnpm** 
- **Rust** (latest stable version)
- **Cargo** (comes with Rust)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bdd-living-doc.git
   cd bdd-living-doc
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build the backend**:

   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   cargo build --release
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Start the backend server**:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   cargo run --release
   ```

   The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`.

2. **Start the frontend development server**:

   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   pnpm run dev
   ```

3. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application in action!

## Roadmap

We're just getting started! Here's what's coming up:

- [ ] **Search Functionality**: Quickly find features and scenarios.
- [ ] **Tag Filtering**: Filter scenarios based on tags.
- [ ] **Dark Mode**: Because everyone loves dark mode! 🌙
- [ ] **Export Options**: Export documentation to PDF or HTML.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Secure access to your documentation.
- [ ] **CI/CD Integration**: Automated updates with your build pipeline.
- [ ] **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization for global teams.
- [ ] **Customization**: Themes and layouts to match your brand.
- [ ] **Backend Enhancements**: Implement caching, improve performance.
- [ ] **Integration with Testing Frameworks**: Link documentation to test results.
